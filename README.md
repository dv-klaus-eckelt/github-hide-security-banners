# github-hide-security-banners

A userscript that makes non-closable security banners above the GitHub project board closeable, i.e.,

* "Connect from an allowed IP address to see items for accounts within the _Stark Industries_ enterprise.",
* "Single sign-on to see items for accounts within the _Stark Industries_ enterprise."


Banners can either be closed once (❌), or closed automatically (🚫) on future visits.
