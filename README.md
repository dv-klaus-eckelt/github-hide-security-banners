# github-hide-security-banners

A userscript that removes non-closable security banners above GitHub project boards, i.e.,

* "Connect from an allowed IP address to see items for accounts within the _Stark Industries_ enterprise.",
* "Single sign-on to see items for accounts within the _Stark Industries_ enterprise."
* 
Banners can either be closed once, or closed automatically on future visits.
